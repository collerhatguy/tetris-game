# Problem: What framework Should be use for building our game?

There are a ridiculous number of JS frameworks that we can use and each has their unique strengths.
The framework must be one I have prior experience with and can handle the asyncrounous nature
of input streams that come with game play.

## Considerations

- React
- Angular

## Decisions

I have decided to use Angular since I have the most amount of experience with it and
it has support for rxjs witch is perfect for handling asyncrounous data of this nature.
