# Problem: How should I handle the AI and Game segregation

I need to decide if the AI should be in the game code or in a seperate repository using a monorepo.

## Considerations

- Using a Husky MonoRepo
- Having a different Github Repo
- Having a the AI share the source code of the game

## Decision

TBD - Will be easiest to decide after the game is built.
